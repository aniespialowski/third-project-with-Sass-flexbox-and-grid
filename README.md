# third-project-with-Sass-flexbox-and-grid
Project "Clinic". It is my third website project. Project was created in HTML5, CSS3, Syntactically awesome style sheets (Sass/SCSS), and Gulp.js. 
The project presents the start page of a "fictional" medical clinic. 
"Responsive Web Design" project - using a Grid and Flexbox.
The project was inspired by a workshop that I did as part of the CSS course from the "strefa.kurs√≥w.pl" platform.
